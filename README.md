# QA Tests Repository

This repository contains automated and manual QA tests for web projects.  
It includes two separate testing stacks:

- 🧪 Playwright — visual regression & automated checks  
- 🌐 Cypress — interactive/manual test runs  

---

# ⚙️ Requirements

Make sure you have installed:

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm
- Git

Check versions:

```bash
node -v
npm -v

🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/alexeysaskevich-dizzain/qa-tests.git
cd qa-tests

🧪 Running Playwright Tests

Playwright is used mainly for:

✔ visual regression
✔ automated page checks

Example (Cymulate DEV)
cd Playwright/cymulate-DEV-wp-regression-tests
npm install
npx playwright test

Update snapshots (baseline)
npx playwright test --update-snapshots

View HTML report
npx playwright show-report

🌐 Running Cypress Tests (Interactive)

Cypress is used for:

✔ manual test runs
✔ debugging
✔ exploratory QA

Start Cypress UI
cd Cypress/cypress-tests
npm install
npx cypress open


👉 This opens the Cypress Test Runner
👉 Select any test and run it manually

🧹 Notes

Tests are designed to run locally

No CI/CD is configured intentionally

Node modules are ignored in Git

🧑‍💻 Typical Workflow
